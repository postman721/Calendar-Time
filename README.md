Dependencies:

The time application requires that you will have python3 and python3-gi packages, or similar installed. The calendar application requires that you will have python-qt4 package, or similar installed.

Note. The dependencies depend upon your distribution of choice – but generally speaking all you need is python with adequate modules.

Execute/run the program(s) with python program.py command. Replace program.py with the actual program name(s).

Python-Calendar provides a basic calendar with multiple colors. You can resize and move this calendar around just as much as you want and it will resize correctly. Current-Time shows date and time. Current-Time cannot be resized – this is a desired feature so that any possible scaling issues could be avoided. You can move Current-Time application around just like a normal window. Both application are lightweight and work well with minimal system resources.
